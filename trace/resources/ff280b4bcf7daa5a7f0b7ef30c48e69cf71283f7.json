Swarming through cities and towns, these sinister creatures feed on people’s Empathy and Compassion, leaving only hollow shells of the afflicted behind.” Nick Percival’s Bloodlines is the world’s first ever NFT only graphic novel and tells the story of four characters battling through a dystopian world where human emotions take on physical forms. Each one of the 45 epic pages in this graphic novel are pieces of art in themselves with some scenes looking too real to believe that they’ve been created, sketched, drawn and painted.
